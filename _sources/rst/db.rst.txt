.. automodule:: AwAws.Db

DynamoDb
========

A very simple CRUD module for DynamoDB.  You will certainly
want to do more that what is available here.  On the other hand,
there is enough here to do simple proof of concept type builds
where you just want to show that you are getting data in the
database.
