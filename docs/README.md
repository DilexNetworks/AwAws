AwAws Documentation
-------------------

The documentation in this directory is generated by sphinx and  can be built
locally by running the following command:
```
make html
```
To view, navigagate to the `_build/html` directory here using your web browser.
On MacOS, you can simply type `open _build/html/index.html`

There are other document options available.  To see the whole
list, just type `make`.  Note that some of the formats will
have dependencies that need to be install manually.

Writing Documentation
---------------------

The markup langauge used to create the documentation is
called **reStructured Text**.

Each module needs it's own page which can just be added to the root
directory where this README file is located (we may change this later).
To get documentation out of the python source, use the python docstring
format which is either just a comment surrounded by double quotes, or the
older format which uses triple double quotes `"""some text"""`.  The idea
is to keep the amount of documentation in the code to a minimum so a typical
python fragment will look something like:
```
    def begin_segment(self, segment_name):
        "creates a new segment"
        if self.status is True:
            self.xray_recorder.begin_segment(segment_name)


    def begin_subsegment(self, sub_segment_name):
        "Create a new segment - use this in lambda functions"
        if self.status is True:
            self.xray_recorder.begin_subsegment(sub_segment_name)
```
