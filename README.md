# AwAws
Aws/Boto3 Wrapper SDK

## Why?

Yeah, boto3 is awsome but it's also pretty dense.  Using a service like SQS
is a real pain when you have to deal with stuff on the JSON level, especially
when a lot of stuff in there is not really are that useful.  That said, the
main idea behind this module is to make life a lot easier when using boto3.

Ultimately, this project is about creating a nice interface bewteens your code
and Aws - so when boto4 comes out, all of the code that needs to be refactired
all lives in one place.

## I know it's a stupid name
One of the hardest things in Computer programming is naming things. So when your
initials are AW and you are writing a wrapper for AWS boto it seems reasonable
to just smush those things together to get AwAws.  In my head it's A W Aws, but
I suspect people will just call is awaws (ah-whas) which is fine by me.
